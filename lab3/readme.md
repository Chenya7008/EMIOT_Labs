### File Descriptions

* **`lab3.ipynb`**: This file contains the code used for battery modeling in the first two parts of Lab 3.
* **`se_sim_trace.txt`**: This shows the simulation results when set up with a serial load.
* **`sim_trace.txt`**: This shows the simulation results using the default simulator settings.
* **Simulator Settings (`lab3-emiot` folder)**: The look-up tables for the PV panels, PV converters, and battery converters have already been added to the configuration files in this folder.
* **`scripts/` folder**: This contains the scripts used to analyze the different stages of Lab 3. Each script is named to match the step it belongs to.
* **`sim_trace_record/` folder**: Log entries documenting the addition of different power sources in the configuration within Part 3: Third Analysis.
* **`samples/` folder**:Includes various fitted data sets, including curve fits for PV panels under different light intensities, as well as efficiency curve fits for PV converters and battery converters.
